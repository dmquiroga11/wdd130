                <p>Rafting is a sporting discipline that reinforces self-esteem and helps us face our fears. Getting on a raft and launching yourself through the imposing rapids of a river is a true act of bravery. After having made a descent, the problems that we have to face daily will no longer seem so important to us. After having had an extreme feeling like this, a new perspective is acquired that strengthens us and allows us to face problems from a much more objective point of view.</p>
